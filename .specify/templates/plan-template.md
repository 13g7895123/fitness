## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality (Principle I)**:
- [ ] Type safety requirements defined for language/framework
- [ ] Linting and formatting tools specified in dependencies
- [ ] Code coverage targets (80% minimum, 95% for critical paths) achievable for this feature
- [ ] Complexity limits considered in architecture (functions <10, modules <15)

**Testing Standards (Principle II)**:
- [ ] TDD approach confirmed (tests written before implementation)
- [ ] Test pyramid ratios achievable (70% unit, 20% integration, 10% e2e)
- [ ] Contract tests planned for all API endpoints
- [ ] Integration tests identified for: external APIs, database, auth, workout/nutrition logic
- [ ] Performance regression tests planned for critical user journeys
- [ ] Accessibility testing approach defined

**User Experience Consistency (Principle III)**:
- [ ] Design system/component library specified
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements documented
- [ ] Responsive breakpoints defined (mobile 320px+, tablet 768px+, desktop 1024px+)
- [ ] Loading states planned for all async operations
- [ ] Error handling strategy defined with user-friendly messages in Traditional Chinese
- [ ] Offline support requirements clarified for core features
- [ ] All UI text, error messages, notifications in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
- [ ] Internationalization approach specified if user-facing text present

**Documentation Standards**:
- [ ] This plan document written in Traditional Chinese (zh-TW)
- [ ] Feature specification (spec.md) in Traditional Chinese
- [ ] User stories and acceptance scenarios in Traditional Chinese
- [ ] API documentation and error messages in Traditional Chinese
- [ ] Code comments for public APIs in Traditional Chinese

**Performance Requirements (Principle IV)**:
- [ ] Page load targets defined (<2s on 3G, <1s broadband)
- [ ] Interaction response targets specified (clicks <100ms, submissions <200ms)
- [ ] Data sync requirements defined (<5s for typical workout data)
- [ ] API latency targets set (p95 <500ms reads, <1000ms writes)
- [ ] Memory usage limits specified (<150MB mobile, <10% heap growth/hour)
- [ ] Battery impact minimized (efficient scheduling, no continuous polling)
- [ ] Database query optimization planned (no N+1, appropriate indexes)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
